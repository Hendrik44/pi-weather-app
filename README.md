# Pi-Weather iOS-, tvOS- and watchOS-App

This project was a part of my bachelor thesis and after some rewrite/refactoring and extending (tvOS- and watchOS-Support) now its opensource. Feel free to extend, customize and optimize and dont forget pull-request ;-)

# What you need:
* [Pi-Weather-Server](https://github.com/Hendrik44/pi-weather-server)
* iOS-/tvOS-/watchOS-Device
* Xcode 9.3 + Swift 4.1
* Carthage

Run: ```carthage update --no-use-binaries```, build project and have fun ðŸŽ‰  
You have to use ```--no-use-binaries``` because the prebuild Binary for Fontawesome is not build with Swift 4.1 otherwise you will get an error.
