# Pi-Weather iOS-, tvOS- and watchOS-App

This project was a part of my bachelor thesis and after some rewrite/refactoring and extending (tvOS- and watchOS-Support) now its opensource. Feel free to extend, customize and optimize and dont forget pull-request ;-)

# What you need:
* [Pi-Weather-Server](https://github.com/Hendrik44/pi-weather-server)
* iOS-/tvOS-/watchOS-Device
* Xcode 8.3 + Swift 3.1
* Carthage

Run: ```carthage update```, build project and have fun ðŸŽ‰   
My pull-request to FontAwesome.Swift is currently only on master so you have to build FontAwesome.swift manually via `carthage build FontAwesome.swift`.
